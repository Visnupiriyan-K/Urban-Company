# Urban Company Care Plus

**Empowering Seniors Through Personalized At-Home Services**  
_A system analysis and design project built on empathy, accessibility, and innovation._

---

## 📌 Overview

Urban Company Care Plus is a proposed extension to the Urban Company platform that introduces personalized, secure, and convenient at-home services for senior citizens and people with disabilities.

Developed as part of IS 685: System Analysis and Design, this project showcases the integration of agile sprint methodologies, stakeholder-centric design, prototyping, and iterative feedback in building a human-focused digital product.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

While the existing Urban Company platform successfully offers home services, it lacks tailored functionality for elderly users. Seniors often face barriers such as:
- Difficulty navigating tech interfaces
- Safety and trust concerns with service providers
- Limited availability of elderly-specific services
- Absence of simplified packages based on health, mobility, or support needs

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Care Plus provides:
- A **dedicated UI** with simplified layouts, larger icons, and guided assistance
- **Specialized services** like mobility aid, elder companionship, home healthcare, and emergency systems
- **Secure onboarding and payments** for trust-building
- **Bestseller-based suggestions** for commonly booked senior services

This solution was built and validated through a 5-day Sprint process, featuring real-time feedback from users and rapid prototyping iterations.

## 👥 Target Audience

- **Caregivers & Family Members** – book and manage services on behalf of seniors
- **Service Professionals** – verified individuals trained to assist with elder care
